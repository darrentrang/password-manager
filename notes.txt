to run the app.js file do
    npm start
must have a package.json setup with
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node app.js"
      },

to run the app.js file with yargs you must do
     npm start -- create -n Darren -u yoshemango -p password
      or else you have to do
     node app.js create -n Darren -u yoshemango -p password


open terminal, navigate to folder, do a "npm init" and press enter through everything. this will create a package.json and you can modify that.
now you can install modules with npm.
example: npm install request@2.60.0 --save
          the --save will save it into the package.json file
